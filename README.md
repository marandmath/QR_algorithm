# QR_algorithm
A short Jupyter Notebook made to implement the QR algorithm variations encountered in my undergraduate class Numerical Analysis II
This lacks any serious theoretical foundation (it can be found in the corresponding lectures of the book by Trefethen and Bau), it
is just a simple implementation of the different variations of the algorithm while looking at an example for each to see its
performance compared to the rest.
